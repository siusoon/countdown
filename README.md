Initiated by William Wong, continued countdown machines are created through different programming languages. 

Original count down machine by Samson Wong and Jason Lam: http://addoilteam.hk/countdown/
Wiliam Wong: Continued by Python 2.7 https://www.facebook.com/the.william.ho/posts/10153558574147036?pnref=story

# How it works
A counter simply counts the time difference between 1st July, 2047 and now. It displays in seconds.

# Note
Interestingly, my PHP server doesn't support year 2047, the max year I can get is 2037. Therefore, I have to add the extra 10 years! (this actually makes the code even more interesting)
I saw people have been using js, python and processing to make the continued Countdown machine, and here I have tried the server side script with a refresh function: <http://siusoon.net/countdown/countdown.php>
